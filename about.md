About Me
========

I'm an applied mathematician working in [Universidad Autonoma de Yucatan](http://www.matematicas.uady.mx).
I enjoy solving applied problems, and learning programming languages, as you can see from my [Github frontpage](http://github.com/ixxra). I collaborate actively with the physics olympiad trainers in my home country.

In what I am now
----------------
  
My interests in science and technology are very wide, as you can see from my current interests:

* I'm helping to develop better policies for <a href="#">Abstraction &amp; application</a>, an electronic journal on applied maths. Currently, that means learning <em>Open Journal System</em>.

* Richard Feynman is my hero, so I'm working on quantum walks with bosons, and hopefully next year will be working in entangled particles traversing a quantum network.

* As I can't be very far from programming, I have developed a few simple web apps with javascript: from a <a href="">personal trainer </a> for the master of science entrance examination in the school where I work to a <a href="/clock.html">Birthday countdown</a>.
